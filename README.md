- Create a Discord bot, tutorial [here](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/discord.html)
  - Change `"token"` to `Bot <your_token>`, example: `Bot O89gea98hgn`
  - Change `"guildID"` under `custom` to the ID of the server you want to use the bot in.

Done!

### Usage

1. `--forcefetch` to quickly check if it works.
2. The bot will now post every 6 hours. (modify the duration inside the code in the "ready" event [line 37] )

## Bugs

Because the library used for Reddit is quite old ("snoowrap", 2 years), ratelimits are not handled at all. You might experience the process crashing with 429 errors. To prevent this, lower the amount of posts fetched. The max should be 1000-900 posts in 10 minutes, if we are to trust the X-ratelimit headers.

## Make sure to add a ‚≠ê if you are using the bot
